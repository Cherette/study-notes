1. What are large language models (LLMs)?
   An LLM is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can generate human-quality text. LLMs are trained on massive datasets of text and code, 
and they can be used for many tasks, such as writing, translating, and coding.
2. What is a benefit of using large language models (LLMs)?
   They can generate human-quality text for tasks such as content creation, writing assistance, and automatic summarization. 
3. What are some of the applications of LLMs?
   LLMs can be used  for many tasks, incuding writing, translating, and coding.
4. What are some of the challenges of using LLMs? Select three options.
   (1) They can be used to generate harmful content.
   (2) They can be expensive to train.
